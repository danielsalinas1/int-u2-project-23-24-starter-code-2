  <h2>What is Deforestation?</h2>
  <p>Deforestation is the purposeful clearing of forested land. Throughout history and into modern times, forests have been razed to make space for agriculture and animal grazing, and to obtain wood for fuel, manufacturing, and construction. Deforestation has greatly altered landscapes around the world.</p>

      <h2>Ozone Depletion</h2>
      <!-- Add text, images, and links for section 2 below. -->
      <p>The ozone layer is the primary greenhouse gas responsible for climate change. When deforestation occurs, much of the carbon stored by trees﻿ is released back into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, which contributes to climate change﻿.

      <h2>Biodiversity</h2>
      <!-- Add text, images, and links for section 3 below. -->
      <p>Without the shelter, food and water the forests supply, the many thousands of species that coexist within and beneath the canopy of trees also vanish. Forests are home to a huge array of different tree, amphibian, bird and mammal species but they are facing a combination of threats.</p>
